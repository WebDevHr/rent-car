				<p> Across his career James has cultivated a number of interests in, for example, the politicaland military
					histories of Byzantium, the Eurasian Steppe, and the Sasanian Empire; Byzantinehistoriography; medieval
					law and commerce; and, perhaps above all, the history of warfare,and in particular the “world crisis”
					which dramatically and permanently reordered the MiddleEast in the course of the seventh century.
					Readers of James’ bibliography up to 2022, which weinclude at the beginning of this volume, will
					perceive the simultaneous cultivation of all theseinterests, but also a growing preoccupation with the
					seventh century, which intensified from the1990s and then culminated in two masterpieces of scholarship
					produced in his retirement—or,as James would say in typical self-depreciating style, his “defunctitude”.
					he first,
					Witnessesto a world crisis
					, represents a distillation of many years of careful rumination on the diversesources for
					seventh-century political history, and a profound reflection on the rise of Islam andthe Arab conquests.
					he second (for which
					Witnesses
					is in many ways the prequel),
					The lastgreat war of antiquity
					, stands now as the first full history of the final conflict of the Romanand Iranian Empires, a grand
					topic of which James has long been the recognised master.</p>
				<p>Readers of James’ books and articles in isolation might not appreciate how deeply they reflecthis
					teaching in Oxford, in particular for two undergraduate courses through which many ofour contributors
					have passed—“he Near East in the age of Justinian and Muhammad”; and“Byzantium in the age of
					Constantine Porphyrogenitus”. he easy but profound familiaritywith each period’s texts; the careful
					dissection of small details; the intellectual flair in theirinterpretation—each is the mark of a tutor
					who has mastered the texts over many years ofrevision, and teased out new interpretations in discussing
					ideas with an ever-changing cast of pupils. James was a key player in the conception of the Late Antique
					and Byzantine Studies Master’s course (LABS), which is now hugely popular (to the extent that James once
					proclaimed,“hey are too many!”). In Oxford James will be remembered above all as a brilliant tutor
					andsupervisor, who energised the young and thrived in the company of the latest generation of
					postgraduate students. When reading in the Lower Reading Room of the Bodleian, he wouldtake a break for
					reflection and refreshment in Brown’s Café in the Covered Market or the King’s Arms, where passing
					students were always invited to join him. </p>
